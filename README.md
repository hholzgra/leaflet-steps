This is a simple visual step-by-step guide showing how to use the 
Leaflet API to create "Slippy Maps" within HTML pages.

Each step builds up on the previous one, first starting with a 
simple most basic map, then adding more features one at a time.

Source code for each step, and diffs to the previous step, are
available but require that the pages are delivered by a webserver
that has PHP installed / enabled.

The actual steps require a small number of NPM modules to be
pre-installed, this can be done by simply running 

  npm install

in the top level directory.
