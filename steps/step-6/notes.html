      Adding a marker to a map is simple, this essentially only requires the marker coordinates and adding a marker icon.
    </p>
    <p>
    Here we use <a href="https://fontawesome.com/">FontAwesome</a>
    and the <a href="https://github.com/lennardv2/Leaflet.awesome-markers">Awsome Markers plugin</a> 
    to easily create marker icons on the fly.
    <p>
    <p>
      Markers allow a lot of actions, e.g. they may be made draggable, or may trigger certain actions when clicked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here we simply bind a popop with simple HTML text content to the marker that gets shown when the marker is clicked.
