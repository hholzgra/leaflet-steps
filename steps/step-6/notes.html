      Adding a marker to a map is simple, this essentially only requires the marker coordinates and adding a marker icon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here we use FontAwesome and the Awsome Markers plugin to easily create marker icons on the fly.

      Markers allow a lot of actions, e.g. they may be made draggable, or may trigger certain actions when clicked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here we simply bind a popop with simple HTML text content to the marker that gets shown when the marker is clicked.
